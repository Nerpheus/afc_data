    and Thamrongthai will join the top four teams from the old second
    division - Rayong, Samut Prakan, Royal Household Bureau and Bank for
    Agriculture and Co-Operatives - to make up a new second tier.
    It was also confirmed that there will be no play-offs for the
    championship this year and just one team will go either down to the
    Second Division and up to the first.
    However, the second bottom team in the top division will have to face
    the second placed team in the second division to decide who takes up a  
    place in the top 12 next year.
